# Lab 1.1: IDE Setup and Tour

## Objective
Get familiar with your development environment and understand the key features of Visual Studio or VS Code for .NET development.

## Duration: 30 minutes

## Theory
The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is your primary tool for .NET development. Visual Studio provides comprehensive tooling for .NET applications, while VS Code offers a lightweight alternative with excellent C# support.

## Exercise

### Part A: IDE Installation Verification (10 minutes)
1. Verify your IDE is properly installed
2. Check .NET SDK installation
3. Install necessary extensions (if using VS Code)

### Part B: IDE Tour (15 minutes)
1. Explore the Solution Explorer
2. Understand the Properties window
3. Learn about IntelliSense
4. Discover debugging tools
5. Find the Package Manager Console/Terminal

### Part C: Customization (5 minutes)
1. Set up your preferred theme
2. Configure basic settings
3. Install useful extensions

## Hands-On Tasks

### Task 1: Verify Installation
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
```bash
dotnet --version
dotnet --list-sdks
```

### Task 2: Create a Test Project
1. Open your IDE
2. Create a new Console Application
3. Name it "HelloWorld"
4. Explore the generated files

### Task 3: IDE Features Exploration
1. Right-click on different elements in Solution Explorer
2. Use Ctrl+Space to trigger IntelliSense
3. Try F12 (Go to Definition) on a method
4. Use Ctrl+Shift+F to search across files

## Expected Output
- Confirmed .NET SDK installation
- Familiarity with IDE layout and basic features
- A simple "Hello World" project created

## Key Takeaways
- The IDE is your command center for development
- IntelliSense provides intelligent code completion
- Solution Explorer organizes your project structure
- Debugging tools are integrated into the IDE

## Next Lab
Lab 1.2 will explore the differences between .NET Framework and modern .NET.
